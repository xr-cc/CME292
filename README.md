# CME292 Advanced MATLAB for Scientific Computing
### Winter Quarter 2022, offered by Stanford ICME in collaboration with Mathworks
Schedule: Winter 2022, Jan 3rd-Jan 31th, Mon/Wed 5:30-7:00pm 

Location: Please see the course [Canvas page](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/150589) for detailed information.


### Course Description

The goal of this 8-lecture short course is to introduce advanced MATLAB features, syntaxes, and toolboxes not traditionally found in introductory courses; applications will be drawn from various topics from scientific computing. Material will be reinforced with in-class examples and demos involving topics from scientific computing. Students will be practicing the knowledge learned through a mini course project, which will be based on either the suggested topics or a topic of their own choice. MATLAB topics to be covered will be drawn from: advanced graphics and animation, MATLAB tools, data management, code optimization, object-oriented programming, and a variety of toolboxes, including optimization, statistical and machine learning, deep learning, parallel computing, and symbolic math. Students should expect to gain exposure to the tools available in the MATLAB software, knowledge of and experience with advanced MATLAB features, and independence as a MATLAB user. Successful completion of the course requires completion of a mini project.

### Prerequisites

CME 192 (Introduction to MATLAB) or equivalent programming background in other languages is highly recommended prior to taking this course. 
Basic knowledge of numerical methods, linear algebra, and machine learning is recommended, but not required.

### Acknolwedgement

The course materials are adapted from a previous version of the course offered by Matthew J. Zahr (ICME alum), and the online resources provided by Mathworks, including the online courses (https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/) and examples (https://www.mathworks.com/help/examples.html). 

The materials are reformatted by Xiran Liu (ICME PhD). Special thanks to Dr. Hung Le from ICME and Dr. Reza Fazel-Rezai from Mathworks for guiding the reformation of course materials.
